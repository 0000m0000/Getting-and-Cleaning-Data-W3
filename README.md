How the R script works
============================

Within this Github repo you find the R code ("run_analysis.R") for performing your analysis about UCI HAR Dataset. The script does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output will be the tidy data set. 
Please also see the attached code book for more details.
